										<p align="Justify">From the very start, I was really excited exploring and wanting to know more about the things that we will tackle and activities we will perform throughout the course also mainly because it is the start or the return of the face to face setup coming from a 2 year online class. It was exciting but I was also hesitant because I was thinking if I can keep up with my classmates since I stopped for a year to work temporarily in order to sustain my school expenses. But when it started, I found it very fun because of the activities. Also, I was able to make new friends slowly which started from my seatmates and which was followed by talking to other classmates even from the other sections from this same course. It started really well and easy but when the midterms came, there were no more guides so we had to find ways on our own. Which I personally did and was really proud of myself as I was able to complete all activities up to the finals completely. In this course, I was able to manage multiple servers while applying automation throught the use of ansible playbook in order to install, configure and manage different kinds of services remotely. Upon finishing this course, I can say that I am fully ready and confident to take the next one with confidence of having masterful knowledge about this course, and with that in mind, I am really hoping that I can make use of this knowledge to my future courses.</p>
